# Genomic-ladder network
Genomic ladder network code is applied on the genomic data, to have binary classification on the RNA-seq data. It was published in [Rasmus et. al. in 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02672.pdf) 


The code is taken from the project previously published github branches:
- [ladder](https://github.com/rinuboney/ladder)
    The original code: has the implementatin of the Ladder network of the mentioned paper.

- [genomic-ladder](https://github.com/acanakoglu/genomic-ladder)
    The optimization for the genomic binary classification is applied to the original code.
